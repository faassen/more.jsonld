JSON-LD support in Morepath:

* a way to centralize id, type and context generation (by app, by
  model class).

* a way to let the user generate really flat output and then frame it
  into the right structure.

* recompact output with friendlier context? i.e. a notion of a context
  reference but also a notion of a context to apply. How does this
  relate to a framing context and a frame, though?

* should a JSON-LD template really be in a file, or should we have
  a way to indicate the frame in code instead?

* the problem with context: if we reuse a sub-object's JSON-LD rendering,
  it should include id and type, but not context. Is this related to
  the difference between serialization with json_dump versus
  exposing a view?

* could we reimplement this based around json_dump?

* how does JSON-LD framing, possibly with the @link option, relate to
  jsonvalue, if at all?

* what about *inputting* JSON-LD content?

@App.ld_compact_context()

@App.ld_frame()

the frame to use. normally no frame.


something to produce a flat graph so that it can be given air in a frame.
